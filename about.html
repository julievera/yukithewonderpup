                        <h3>Preface</h3>
                        <p>Hey there! We are Robby and Julie, Yuki's fur-parents. Before we proceed, we want to thank the fine folks (you know who you are!) at St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center in Madison, NJ. <em>These guys perform miracles.</em> Huge thanks to Humane Society International for going out of your way to make sure these dogs have a shot at a good life. Thank you to the ASPCA and the Animal Welfare League of Alexandria, VA for welcoming Yuki and 22 of her brothers and sisters to the United States with the care they desperately needed. Lastly, thank you to everyone who rescues pups in need or helps support the efforts of organizaitons such as St. Hubert's, HSI, or the ASPCA. We need more people like you in the world.</p>
                        <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                        <p>The story of Yuki the Wonder Pup began in March 2015. We were on our honeymoon, traveling around Japan and South Korea for a few weeks, trying desperately to re-create the exploits of our TV favorite, Anthony Bourdain. We arrived in Tokyo after a very long flight and decided to hunker down for some entertaining Japanese television. Flipping through the channels, we came across a news program reporting on a large-scale dog rescue operation. Almost jokingly, we turned to each other and said "we should take one of those pups home with us!" We had no idea that we had just spotted our future pup on TV!</p>
                        <h3>About The Little "Bear"</h3>
                        <p>
                        Yuki (formerly "Robin") was born on a South Korean <a href="bit.ly/1Fo5hsf">meat farm</a>. At the age of 1, she was rescued by the Humane Society International, along with 22 other dogs. After being brought to the United States, all but 2 dogs were immediately adopted out. Yuki and another dog were placed in the ASPCA's Behavioral Rehabilitation Center at St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center in Madison, New Jersey. Because of the horrible abuse she suffered and an extreme lack of socialization, her handlers were concerned that Yuki would never be able to be placed in a home. Just over 6 months later, she's made AMAZING progress, graduating from St. Hubert's Rehabilitation Center program with flying colors.</p>
                        <p> When we first met Yuki, she was wary of us - however, she would play with her trainers, solicit neck scratches, and lick their faces, especially when the squeaky toys came out. We instantly fell in love with her.</p>
                        <p> Now, nearly 9 months after arriving in the U.S., Yuki has landed in her first and forever home in Boston. We're just at the beginning of a difficult journey for Yuki. She's <em>slowly</em> warming up to us. While it can be emotionally draining to care for a dog who initially won't let you come close or can't even fathom the idea of a leash, Yuki is such an incredibly good dog at heart. The work we do with her will pay off exponentially in love and puppy kisses. Our hope for this blog is to raise awareness of the ongoing meat trade in South Korea and to document the progress of Yuki - a dog that is still learning how to be a dog.
